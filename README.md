Conversations about teaching computational skills to undergraduates

This repostitory has been created as an extension of a 'Birds of a Feather' discussion at the
2017 iEvoBio conference, where ideas where bandied about for building new undergraduate
bioinformatics curricula and teaching undergraduates computing generally. We wanted a centralized place to put those ideas, but also wanted to make
sure they were accessible to the broader community. Thank you GitHub :)

If you have ideas or would like to contribute to the discussion, please do so in [the issues
tracker](https://github.com/carpentries/undergrad-education-conversations/issues). Below are bullet
points posing questions and describing the general flow of our discussion; these points will be adapted into more coherent
issues shortly.

* Is there some cost associated with teaching undergrads the traditionally memory
intensive biology content at the same time as the more logic focused computational content?
* How do we deal with coding fear?
  * The very first skill students require is to not be terrified
  * Semester long SWC/DC-esk course(s) very early
* Continue to incorporate computation throughout all or most core curriculum
  * We need curricula road maps; identify the short, medium, and long term learning objectives, and
make a plan to get there.
  * Can't assume current faculty will be able to do this on their own, so training TA's or having
dedicated personnel will be important
* Domain-specific skills will be important and even 'bioinformatics' is broad, so what commonalities can be extracted to give students the best
framework for branching into more specialized topics later?
  * Basic coding skills
  * Basic shell tools
  * Focus on what to do with tabular data, statistics, modelling, noisy matrices
  * Teach students to troubleshoot and to learn from manuals/forums/peers/etc
  * Do's and don'ts for basic script design (antipatterns)
